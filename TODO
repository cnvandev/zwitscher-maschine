TODO
================================================================================

- Find out why sample.py is being given a dict randomly - something isn't being
popped. Find it!
- A module to get Twitter Bootstrap for you for automation purposes. Should
just copy/modify code from Cruddy to do so.
- Code up the examples at http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/getting-started.html#examples
and see if you can come up with any examples so you can streamline the code
generation.
- Convert every function to use the new first-argument-is-a-hash system, create
convenience functions that return common attribute patterns (example:
hint_text("Hint!") for hint text passed to search inputs.)
- A "Sectioned page" like the Bootstrap site. Give it a set of titles and
content and it generates something with a navbar for you.
- Work with the Javascript stuff. Maybe create (sigh) a Python Javascript
generator and work that into Zwitscher-maschine. Maybe a JQuery-specific
generator.
